    <p>The plan for my project is create a drawing of a house using the element called canvas. My vision is to create a house with a roof, the main body, and a door. I will start by creating an html file called index.html, portraying the drawing of the house. Then, I will create the javascript file that will contain the code of my drawing.</p>
