    <li>The plan for my project is create a drawing of a house using the element called canvas. My vision is to create a house with a roof, the main body, and a door. I will start by creating an html file called index.html, portraying the drawing of the house. Then, I will create the javascript file that will contain the code of my drawing.</li>

    <li>My scene will include a basketball bouncing up and down. The movements I would like to include in my scene are the bouncing up and down motion. I will use conditional statements to make the ball move in a certain direction. I will need varaibles to store information about where something is. I would like to review the setInterval skill. I can maybe review this in my notes. My detailed animation will be a basket ball bouncing up and down. My only object will be a basketball. The position of the ball.</li>
